# Vesper, My Angel
(Shes A Cat)

### Our Story
I wanted a cat for the longest time before I got Vesper, basically since I left for college. It wasn't until I settled in here at Mizzou, though, that I knew I was ready. I would have loved to get a kitten but I decided that I wanted to adopt an adult cat since I know they have a lower chance of getting permanent home. One thing that I did know though, was that I for sure wanted an all white cat. The reason for this was because I wanted to be able to dye its fur (pet safe dye, of course). I thought it would be so fun to have a kitty with pink or purple paws and a tail walking around. Little did I know when my boyfriend and I walked into Second Chance animal shelter in Booneville, Missouri that a little black cat would be coming home with me. We looked at all the cats and I ended up falling in  love with her because she was cuddly and liked to be held, and her fur was medium length which kind of set her apart. Her shelter name was Natalie Black which I hated, so we named her Vesper, after Vesper Lynd in James Bond: Casino Royale. She is the sweetest baby and she always chirps hello when you look at her or pet her. She's my angel.

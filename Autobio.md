# A Short "Autobiography" of My Life Thus Far
Its really just some looking back and reflecting
### My Core Memories 
I loved my childhood. I was blessed with a great one. I remember chasing fireflies in my front yard, right across the street from a park with a bandstand in the middle where the orchestra would play every Sunday evening in June. I remember planting tulips around the two front trees in that same front yard with my mom. I remember placing pennies on the tracks at the railroad stop in my small hometown with my dad, and collecting them after the train had passed. If you did it right and they didn't fall off they'd be as flat as a peice of paper. I remember riding my bike and scooter around the block with my siblings and talking to each other through walkie talkies when we would split up. My cousins would come visit twice a year: in August around my birthday, and at Christmas, and we always found something fun to do. We built blanket forts in Grandma's basement and would race to see who could shuck corn the fastest..

I look back on my childhood and almost always smile. Life was, and still is, so good. Sometimes though, there is a seed of sadness knowing now what I didn't then. It's inevitable that at some point we all understand things that we don't want to. Things like war, and injustice, and true suffering. But I can hold onto the hope that somehow I can find a way to make the world a better place, and as I grow older and wiser, I like to think that my role in that could too. Make a difference, and make it bigger as time goes on.

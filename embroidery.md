# Adrie's Embroidery
*My new business venture*

### The Details
So I recently developed the idea of getting an embroidery machine and selling crewnecks and hoodies, tshirts, bucket hats, ball caps, beanies, you name it. I'm still working on some of my designs but I'm thinking some cute little things like frogs and mushrooms and stuff like that along with some Star Wars designs and maybe some pokemon ones too. I just got my machine on the first of May and I'm already obsessed with it. I've been trying to keep my distance so I can focus on finals but it is HARD. We will see how this business goes. People seem interested but its tough to know if they'll buy. So long as I break even on my expenses I will be perfectly content because then I just get to have an embroidery machine. 

Here is a picture of my favorite piece I've done so far:

**Ahsoka Tano is a character introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. She is Anakin Skywalkers padawan and a fan favorite. The character made her first live action appearance in an episode of the second season of The Mandolorian, and was played by Rosario Dawson.**

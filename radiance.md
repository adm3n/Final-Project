# Radiance Cosmetic Artisrty
*My makeup business*

### The Business:
I've done makeup on my two sisters and close friends for as long as I can remember, but it was in highschool that I really found out it was my passion. I was getting paid by other girls at school to do their makeup for homecoming and prom, and it was so much fun. I took an entrepreneurship course that taught me the basics of running a business and hooked me up with a mentor. Then we were able to take out business loans in order to start our business. I borrowed some money, stocked my kit with the product I bought, and the rest is history. 

### My Services:
I still do makeup for prom and homecoming, but I've branched out since high school. I now mostly do makeup for bridal parties and weddings, which is good because it's my favorite to do. I love the energy that radiates from the bride and her bridesmaids getting ready for such a special day. I also do stuff for photoshoots like engagement photos and maternity photos and stuff like that. I'm working right now on booking a music video where I would get to do some special effects makeup which is so fun to do (especially outside of Halloween)!
